# Lab 6 - Part I
# Matthew Stephenson
# This program computes factorial for a value (N) entered by the user.
# STEP 1: Prompt the user for N and read it in and convert it into an integer\
    
# STEP 2: Initialize factorial to a default value before multiplying

# values into it
# STEP 3: Complete the following loop to compute factorial

while N > : # STEP 3a: what is the condition to keep going?

    # STEP 3b: multiply N x factorial and save it back into factorial variable

    # STEP 3c: decrement N by 1

# Step 4: Print out The resulting factorial value
